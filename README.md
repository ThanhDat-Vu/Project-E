# Project-E: Full Stack E-Commerce React Application

Project-E is a high-performance, full-stack e-commerce web application that is built with cutting-edge technologies. The website is fully responsive and user-friendly. It has all of the essential features of a modern e-commerce website.

## Lessons Learned

Aside from technical knowledge, I learned that it is difficult to create a perfect project plan that outlines all the tasks I need to accomplish. Problems might arise at any time, and sometimes I realize that I was heading in the wrong direction. It is, nevertheless, what makes programming interesting. The more tasks I complete, the more problems I solve, the more valuable experience I gain, the better the project.

## Bug

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/ThanhDat-Vu/Project-E/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result.
